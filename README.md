"Data and viz of interest"
Upon starting this class, an article that interests me is "Ethical Considerations in Data Science and AI", which ties ethics to the use of AI; a major upcoming product in today's society. We must be responsible about the training of AI models and how they are used. For example, stable diffusion models can be used to spread misinformation, so there must be a way to distinguish between real and fake information.

When learning about how to visualize data, this particlar data visualization caught my eye because it provides a clear correlation between GDP and life expectancy in countries around the world. By looking at the data, we get a clear and concise understanding of how life expectancy goes up with higher GDPs, highlighting a grave problem that can be gradually mitigated by contributing to the GDPs of other countries.

Some more ideas that I took a look at to investigate further were Housing Injustice (https://www.brookings.edu/articles/homeownership-racial-segregation-and-policies-for-racial-wealth-equity/) and Workplace Injuries and Labor Laws (https://www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm).

"Ideas from curated datasets & project lists"
I also looked at "Deaths in US jails." This data is collected by Reuters to publicize the deaths that occur in jails between 2008 and 2019. This data would otherwise not be public; Reuters sent out 1,500+ requests to access this data, which state governments are required to respond to. Coding can help understand trends in the data, like which states have the most deaths, or how deaths have increased/decreased over time.

Lastly, I looked at "Sources of income, and expenditures, for college athletics." This data shows the total expenses in college athletics, and the different portions of those expenditures. Coding can help understand which portions of the expenditures can be reduced to increase the other portions. It can also help analyze how expenditures have increased/decreased over time. https://knightnewhousedata.org/

**Potential Final Project Ideas**
A question that I want to answer through the research for my final project is "How can data trends help build a strong, truthful claim?" Through my research, I want to be careful of accidentally portraying misinformation or a false narrative with data analysis. The research idea that I have the strongest interest in is the "Death in US jails" dataset. The dataset is very large, with death data from different county prisons per state. My plan is to analyze only a subset of California counties and see what the trend shows. Some potential claims that could be made are how certain prisons are strict with the wellness of inmates, while others are not. Moreover, certain prisons may have an increase in deaths, which could mean that certain laws (regarding prison management) became lax.
